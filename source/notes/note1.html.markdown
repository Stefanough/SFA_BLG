* **Function** - Suppose that to each element in a set A there is assigned, by some manner or other, a unique element of a set B. We call such assignments a function. For every input into a function, there is a unique output.

* **Statement** - A series of symbols, methods, operators, operands, functions or variables that has a complete meaning. ` x = 3 + 9 ` is a statement. A statement is syntacticly correct and has meaning.

* **Segfault** - In computing, a segmentation fault (often shortened to segfault) or access violation is a fault, or failure condition, raised by hardware with memory protection, notifying an operating system (OS) the software has attempted to access a restricted area of memory (a memory access violation). On standard x86 computers (which includes most PC computers) this is a form of general protection fault. The OS kernel will, in response, usually perform some corrective action, generally passing the fault on to the offending process by sending the process a signal. Processes can in some cases install a custom signal handler, allowing them to recover on their own,[1] but otherwise the OS default signal handler is used, generally causing abnormal termination of the process (a program crash), and sometimes a core dump.
