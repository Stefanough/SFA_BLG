Design Ideas/goals:
-------------------

**Want**
    - ~~vertica nav bar~~ No, horizontal for now.
        - blog
        - notes
        - photos
        - about
    - front page with just latest updates
    - ~~folder for aricles~~
    - ~~folder for notes~~

#### Plan for notes page:
* main notes page will have links to differente subject (Ruby, Rails, Sql, Vim, Etc...)
*     each link goes to a markdown file of that subjects notes. One markdown file per subject?
*     different sections for programming related notes and others?
*     add front matter to each notes page? subject and whatnot?


* Imagined workflow:???

Timeline:
---------

* ~~get blog link in navbar to link to /blog~~
    * had to link to /blog.html to get to the blog.html.erb file
* different ==layouts== for blog page and front page
* just created two blogs in the 'basic_blog' project - "scribbles" and "notes"
*     removed all previous articeles and notes
*     use <https://billyfung.com/writing/2017/01/multiple-blogs-with-middleman/>
*     how do I render pages from both blogs where I want them?
* Current error when launching MM server and loading front page: `you must either use the flag --blog (ex. --blog 'myBlog') when calling this method, or add blog: [blog_name] to your page's frontmatter`
*     What is causing this error? There is a `blog_controller` method in the middleman-blog gem.
*     Changed `page_articles.each`... method to `blog('scribbles').page_articles.each`... method
*         new error: `undefined method page_articles' for #<Middleman::Blog::BlogData:0x00000003a32958>`
*
*    Solved above error. Cause was another call to `blog.articles` method with out specifing blog name. changed to `blog('scribbles').articles`.
*    ToDo: add a few large notes markdown files to `/notes` and have them displayed as links on hte main notes page.
*   ~~ToDo: change how articles are generated. Want to generate 'notes articles' without the date in the filename.~~
*       Solved by changing blog configuration in `config.rb` with the option `blog.sources = "{title}.html"`
* Get notes to render how I want I want.
* pass options to the markdown configuration:
 
      ```ruby
      set :markdown,
      fenced_code_blocks: true,
      strikethrough: true,
      smartypants: true
      ```
      set the `strikethrough` option to `true` and pass it to `:markdown`
      

Notes:
------

* **layout files** - Should have only the template language extension. In this case `.erb`
 
* **template files** - Will be rendered in html and should have the extension `.html.erb`
