**Dynamic and Static typing**
Describes when the constraints on types are checked or enforced. The types for variables in statically typed languages are known at compile time and type errors are surfaced then. The types for data in dynamically typed languages are only known at runtime.

**Strong and Weakly typed languages**

**Structural vs Nominal typing**
JavaScript is generally

**Variadic Function**
A function that can take a variable number of arguments. Said to have an indefinite _arity_ (as in a function that takes 1 argument is _unary_ and a function that takes 2 arguments is _binary_, these are both fixed-arity). - Programming TypeScript

**Overloaded Function**
A function with multiple call signatures

**Generic Type**
A placeholder type used to enforce a type-level constraint in multiple places. Also known as polymorphic type parameter. - Programming TypeScript.

**Parameter vs Argument**
- A parameter is a piece of data that a function needs to run, declared as part of a function declaration. Also called a formal parameter.
- An argument is a piece of data that you passed into a function when invoking it. Also called an actual parameter.

**Types of Instructions??**
- Command vs Conditional
- what else???
-

**Mixin**
A class that contains methods for use by other classes with having to be the parent class of those other classes. Basically, _mixin_ some functionality from other classes or functions/methods defined in another location without having to inherit everything from a class.

**Online Optimization** - A field of optimization theory having no or incomplete knowledge of the future (online). These problems are denoted a s online problems and are seen as opposed to the classical optimization problems where complete information is assumed (offline).

**HyperText, HyperMedia, HyperAnything** - What is the original dream of Hyper Media? I think about internally linked spaces. Traveling to different documents without ever leaving the document-based (or media-based) world. Instead of leaving a document to find and open another, why not just have the method of traveling to a relevant document embedded in that document itself? A frame work or infrastructure that is above or outside of the document space that facilitates easy traversal? Is that the 'Hyper' in HyperText?

**Haml** - Html abstraction markup language

**Sass** - Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets. Sass is a scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

**SCSS** - A newer syntactical variant of Sass.  SCSS uses block formatting like that of CSS. It uses braces to denote code blocks and semicolons to separate lines within a block. The indented syntax and SCSS files are traditionally given the extensions `.sass` and `.scss`, respectively.

**Coffeescript** - CoffeeScript is a programming language that transpiles to JavaScript. It adds syntactic sugar inspired by Ruby, Python and Haskell in an effort to enhance JavaScript's brevity and readability.[3] Specific additional features include list comprehension and pattern matching.

**Higher Order Functions** - Tools that can take other functions as parameters and return functions as results.

**Hashes and Hash as it relates to 'Hashing Functions'** -

**Endianness** - The order in which a system stores and retrieves bytes into memory. In *Little Endian* machines, the last byte of binary representation of multi-byte data is stored first. In *Big Endian* systems, the first byte of binary representation of multi-byte data is stored first.

BigEndian:

| 0x100 | 0x101 | 0x102 | 0x103 |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
|    01 |    23 |    45 |    67 |

LittleEndian:

| 0x100 | 0x101 | 0x102 | 0x103 |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
|    67 |    45 |    23 |    01 |

**Function** - Suppose that to each element in a set A there is assigned, by some manner or other, a unique element of a set B. We call such assignments a function. For every input into a function, there is a unique output.

**Statement** - A series of symbols, methods, operators, operands, functions or variables that has a complete meaning. x = 3 + 9 is a statement. A statement is syntactically correct and has meaning.

**Segfault** - In computing, a segmentation fault (often shortened to segfault) or access violation is a fault, or failure condition, raised by hardware with memory protection, notifying an operating system (OS) the software has attempted to access a restricted area of memory (a memory access violation). On standard x86 computers (which includes most PC computers) this is a form of general protection fault. The OS kernel will, in response, usually perform some corrective action, generally passing the fault on to the offending process by sending the process a signal. Processes can in some cases install a custom signal handler, allowing them to recover on their own,[1] but otherwise the OS default signal handler is used, generally causing abnormal termination of the process (a program crash), and sometimes a core dump.

  Trying to access a part of memory that you don't have access to.

**Hashing Function** -

**Hash** -

**Encryption v Encoding** -

**Word** - (A word)

**Lexeme** - A lexeme is a string of characters which forms a syntactic unit.

  Some authors just call this a token, using 'token' interchangeably to represent (a) the string being tokenized, and also (b) the token data structure resulting from putting this string through the tokenization process.

  Note that the usage of the word 'lexeme' in computer science is different from the meaning of the word 'lexeme' in linguistics. A lexeme in computer science roughly corresponds to what in linguistics might be called a word (in computer science, 'word' has a different meaning than the meaning of 'word' in linguistics), although in some cases it may be more similar to a morpheme.

**Kilobyte v Kibibyte** - A Kilobyte is a *decimal multiple* of the unit byte for quantities of information and is one thousand (10^3) bytes of data. A kibibyte is a *binary multiple* of the unit byte for quantities of information and is 2^10 (1024) bytes of data. Sometimes they are used interchangeably. A mebibyte is 1024^2 (2^20) bytes of data and is sometimes used interchangeably with megabyte which is 1,000,000 (10^6 or 1000^2) bytes of data. These binary/decimal pairs of multiples of bytes exist for all notations for quantities of digital information.

**Syntactic Sugar** -

**RFC** - Request For Comments. A formal document from the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) that presents technical or informative content for review on it's way to potentially become a standard. Of those that are intended to become Internet standards, the final version of the RFC becomes the standard and no further comments or changes are permitted.

**REPL** - Stands for Read Evaluate Print Loop. IRB and PRY are Ruby REPLs.

**Helper or Helper Method** -

**Closure** -

**Is there a general way to interpret certain characters in code? Do `/`, `:`, `.`, `::`, `//`, `,` have meanings that can be interpreted as general across languages/platforms?**

**Markup** -

**Markdown** -

**Buffer** - Generic term for a chunk of memory that currently being processed or worked on.

**Library** -

**< >, " ", [ ], { } in documentation** -

**Syntax** -

**Macro** - Short for 'macroinstruction'
  > A single instruction that expands automatically into a set of instructions to perform a particular task.

**Tree** -

**Algorithm** -

**Octet** - A term for 8 bits of digital information. Overwhelmingly synonymous with the word *byte* in modern digital computing as most systems interpret and refer to a discreet, 8 bit chunk of data as a byte.
  > Octets are often expressed and displayed using a variety of representations, for example in the hexadecimal, decimal, or octal number systems. The binary value of all 8 bits set (or activated) is 11111111 (base 2), equal to the hexadecimal value FF (base 16), the decimal value 255 (base 10), and the octal value 377 (base 8). One octet can be used to represent decimal values ranging from 0 to 255. - *Wikipedia*

**Byte** - A discrete collection of bits. In almost all modern systems a byte is 8 bits of information representing 256 states. Also known as a word.

**API** - Application Programming Interface. The API of our Rails objects are just their publicly available methods.

  Another way of thinking about an API: the rules for what you can input into a specific program and what output you can expect given valid input. Makes a program predictable.

  Also sometimes called a service. An API might take the form of the data you get back from a server when you make a request. It may not be formatted into HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, but just be "raw data" in the form of JSON or some other format. There is a distinction between an website (which contains assets in the forms that can be rendered by a browser like HTML) and a web-service (just raw data).

  *So, why would you want raw data?*
  Some applications or websites already have special ways of rendering information but they still need data from a source to know what to render. An application may use the Google maps API, for example, to get data about locations to render in an ancillary window or a mobile application. Also, servers use web-services all the time to send data back and forth, data that never needs to be rendered or formatted in a human readable form.
  > * The published interface or published set of rules for how a particular piece of software works and how you use it.
  > * In Rails, the API are the HTTP routes.

  If I have a web application running on Rails and I make a HTTP GET request to /cats, I'll get back a bunch of cat pictures.
  > In this case, GET is the HTTP method in the request and /cats is a path.

**BIOS** - Stands for Basic/Input Output System. A firmware used to perform hardware initialization during the booting process of IBM compatible PCs and to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs.

**DSL** - Domain Specific Language, as opposed to a GPL (General Purpose Language), is a computer language specialized to a specific application domain. These are languages designed for targeting specific problems instead of any generalized problem. Examples of DSLs include HTML for web pages and SQL for database queries. An *internal DSL* inside Ruby is used for defining routes in a Rails `routes.rb` file.

**JSON** - JavaScript Object Notation
  > ...an open-standard format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs. It is the most common data format used for asynchronous browser/server communication, largely replacing XML which is used by AJAX. - *Wikipedia*  

  Json is a language independent data format derived from JavaScript. Its data types are: `Number`, `String`, `Boolean`, `Array`, and `Null`. The official MIME type for JSON is `application/json`. See also YAML and XML

  example of data in JSON format:

```json
[{"preference":"transptcw10","value":false},
  {"preference":"tabseparator","value":"tabsep_black"},
  {"preference":"nbiconsize","value":"small"}
```
