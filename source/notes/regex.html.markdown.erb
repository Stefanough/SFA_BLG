**Is regex a DSL?** - 

**regex rules**

```ruby
Character   Meaning
------------------------------------------------------------
^           # Anchor for the begning of a line
$           # Anchor for the end of a line
\A          # Anchor for the start of a string
\Z          # Anchor for the end of a string
.           # Any character
\w          # Any letter, digit, or underscore
\W          # Anything that \w doesnt match
\d          # Any digit
\D          # Anything that \d doesnt't match (non-digits)
\s          # Whitespace (spaces, tas, newlines, and so on)
\S          # Non-whitespace (any visible character)
```


**usefull expresions**

```ruby
string.scan( /<([^>]*)>/)
```
This pulls everything between `<` and `>` out as a string
