**What?**

I built this site to act as a multi-pronged offense to get back into coding.  I thinkg of it as my weaponized blog and so can you. It's designed to kick me in the ass on multiple fronts. Code more, write more, design more, think more.

I could have just launched a Wordpress or Django site like I have in the past but I wanted to build something by hand and I wanted to know how it works.

The first website I ever mannaged to hack together was a hideous thing but I wrote every line of HTML by hand and knew what did what and why. It was hideous - like a childs model airplane dripping 

I have Dabbled in Rails and know the joys of watching my Ruby code churn out HTML and display my data and content. A Rails site is a bit heavy for what I wanted in a weaponized blog (I'm thinking more guirrilla tactics here) and it rely's on databases (what even are those?)  but if I could use ruby and markdown to coble together a...

A friend told me about framework that lets me build a website, and re-re-re-teach myself Ruby

Enter Middleman. Middleman is a framwork for building static websites with Ruby. Before the web was a sea of 'web-apps' bristling with APIs, it was mostly static pages. The first page on web as we know it today was a static page. If you want to dissemenate information quickly and in the most compatible way, a static site is the way to go.

I wanted a blog but with some features that a full featured website might have. I wanted a separate section for my notes.


**How?**

There are some great guides out there for getting started with Middleman. I'll go over how I set up this site. I'll use basic instructions and explanations because if you're like me you really need your hand held through this stuff and that's OK.

install Middleman and the Middleman blog extension. The blog extension adds extra functionality such as tagging and article generation to the default instalation.

```
$ gem install middleman middleman-blog
```

Initialize your Middleman project. Pass the `blog` parameter to the `--template` option to initialize it with the blogging functionality

```
$ middleman init my_fresh_blog --template=blog
```

`cd` into your project directory and start the test server.

```
$ cd my_fresh_blog
$ middleman server
```

Point your borwser to localhost and you see:

This still intimidates me. The blog skeleton is so barebones. There are middle man templates that give you immediate satisfaction of having something that looks like a fully-featured, bigass website (I looked at a lot of them). I wanted something that was leaner, uglier and ripe for customization. it's truly a blank canvas.
