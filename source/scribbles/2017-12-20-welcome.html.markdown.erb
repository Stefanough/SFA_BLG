Hi I'm Stefan and I want to work as a professional software developer. I built this site (read more about the technical side of this site **here**) to function as my main tool and record of my journey towards this goal.

The <%= link_to('blog', '/blog') %> section of this site contains more general writing and thoughts on projects and exercises I'm currently working on.  <%= link_to('Notes', '/notes') %> contains more technical explanations and definitions as well as blocks of code I think are relevant. *Projects* contains (mostly, I hope) finished projects.

Although everything on this site is public facing, it's also a place for me to walk myself through problems and sort of converse with myself as I strive towards something like an intuitive understanding of the programming challenges I'm grappling with.

More about myself and I **here**. You can find me on <%= link_to 'github', 'https://github.com/Stefanough' %> and <%= link_to 'linkedin', 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefan-armijo-3a287715/' %>. Drop me a line at stefan.armijo\<at>gmail.com.
