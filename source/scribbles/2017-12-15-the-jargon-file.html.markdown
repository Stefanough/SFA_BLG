<!-- * The Jargon file
* notes scribbled on to graph paper
* having a conversation with myself through notes
* walking through problems
* these are more for me than for you but I still want to share them
* these notes (as well as the site) are alive and subject to constant change and revision
* not all of these concepts can reach the level of intuition that I'd like but I'll try -->

When I started taking the idea of learning to program seriously, I quickly came to some important realizations. The logic and concepts surrounding programming were far removed from the photography and editing I had been doing up to that point. I had to beat this new information into my brain by taking copious notes. I also ~~had~~ have a desire to attempt to smash everything down to a level of understanding I consider intuitive. The act of talking to myself through my notes and tediously walking through every little step or detail of a data-type or an algorithm was the most enjoyable way for me to move forward.

I developed my own little system that let me jot down notes, thoughts, explanations, questions, definitions, and ideas. The reality was that this beautiful simplicity existed because all of those -- everything, in fact -- was contained in one massive document. A document I named `Jargon.md` and referred to as *The Jargon File*. Unbeknownst to me at the time, this was not the first Jargon file.

In 1975 students at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory created a file named `AIWORD.RF` which was collectively and haphazardly revised with the terminology and definitions springing from nascent hacker culture. The file was forked by students at MIT and renamed to  `AI:MRC;SAIL JARGON` aka The Jargon File. Throughout the 70’s and early 80’s The Jargon File existed as a living document contributed to by the likes of Mark Crispin, Don Woods, and Richard Stallman. I organiclay stumbled upon the spirit and the exact name of The Jargon File. I took this as a good sign.

My notes on this page have been cleaned up, sectioned, and reformatted but they are all derived from my original Jargon File. Other than making everything prettier and available to the world, my goal is to treat my notes as I always have: a place to keep questions, important definitions, and hacky bits of knowledge as they enter my scope.
