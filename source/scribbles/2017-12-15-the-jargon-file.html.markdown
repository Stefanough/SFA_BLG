* The Jargon file
* notes scribbled on to graph paper
* having a conversation with myself through notes
* walking through problems
* these are more for me than for you but I still want to share them
* these notes (as well as the site) are alive and subject to constant change and revision
* not all of these concepts can reach the level of intuition that I'd like but I'll try
