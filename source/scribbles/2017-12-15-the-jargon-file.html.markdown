* The Jargon file
* notes scribbled on to graph paper
* having a conversation with myself through notes
* walking through problems
* these are more for me than for you but I still want to share them
* these notes (as well as the site) are alive and subject to constant change and revision
* not all of these concepts can reach the level of intuition that I'd like but I'll try

When I started toying with the idea of learning programming, I made a few realizations very quickly. It had been a few years since I had been in school proper and it flelt like my brain was out of shape. I had to beat the information into my brain by taking copious notes. The act of talking to myself through my notes and tediously walking through every little step and detail of a data-type or an algorithm was the only way I was able to improve. I ~~had~~ have this desire to smash everything down to a very intuitive level of understanding.

So I started taking notes. Spending more time getting my chicken scratch figures and
diagrams down on crumpled graph paper was perhaps not the best strategy, but what could I
do?

I eventually got to a point to where I felt more comfortable (better at typing lol) with
keeping my documents on my computer. I developed a system where I could quickly jot down notes, thoughts, explanations, questions, defenitions, and ideas. The reality was that this beautiful simplicity was due to the fact that all of those -- everything, infact -- was contained in one massive document. A document I had named `Jargon.md`. *The Jargon File*

Unbeknownest to me, this was not the first Jargon file...
