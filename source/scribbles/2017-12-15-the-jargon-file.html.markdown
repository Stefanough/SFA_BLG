<!-- * The Jargon file
* notes scribbled on to graph paper
* having a conversation with myself through notes
* walking through problems
* these are more for me than for you but I still want to share them
* these notes (as well as the site) are alive and subject to constant change and revision
* not all of these concepts can reach the level of intuition that I'd like but I'll try -->

About two years ago, I decided to learn computer programming. I also started to jot down notes, thoughts, explanations, questions, definitions, and ideas. All of those -- everything, in fact -- was contained in one massive document. I named it `Jargon.md` and referred to as *The Jargon File*. Unbeknownst to me at the time, this was not the first Jargon file...

In 1975 students at [SAIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University_centers_and_institutes#Stanford_Artificial_Intelligence_Laboratory) created a file named `AIWORD.RF` which was collectively revised with the terminology and definitions springing from nascent hacker culture. The file was forked by students at MIT and renamed  `AI:MRC;SAIL JARGON` aka the [Jargon File](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jargon_File). Throughout the 70’s and early 80’s the Jargon File was alive and, contributed to by the likes of Mark Crispin, Don Woods, and Richard Stallman. I sort of organically stumbled upon the spirit and the exact name of The Jargon File. I took this as a good sign.

My notes here are cleaned up, sectioned, and formatted but they are all derived from my original Jargon File. Other than making everything prettier and available to the world, my goal is to treat my notes as I always have: a place to keep questions, important definitions, and hacky bits of knowledge as they enter my field of view.
